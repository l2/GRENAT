% Information from the Mathworks website
%  Weight and Bias Values
%  
%  These properties define the network's adjustable parameters: its weight matrices and bias vectors.
%  
%  net.IW
%  
%  This property defines the weight matrices of weights going to layers from network inputs. It is always an Nl x Ni cell array, where Nl is the number of network layers (net.numLayers), and Ni is the number of network inputs (net.numInputs).
%  
%  The weight matrix for the weight going to the ith layer from the jth input (or a null matrix []) is located at net.IW{i,j} if net.inputConnect(i,j) is 1 (or 0).
%  
%  The weight matrix has as many rows as the size of the layer it goes to (net.layers{i}.size). It has as many columns as the product of the input size with the number of delays associated with the weight.
%  
%      *
%  
%        net.inputs{j}.size * length(net.inputWeights{i,j}.delays)
%  
%  These dimensions can also be obtained from the input weight properties.
%  
%      *
%  
%        net.inputWeights{i,j}.size
%  
%  net.LW
%  
%  This property defines the weight matrices of weights going to layers from other layers. It is always an Nl x Nl cell array, where Nl is the number of network layers (net.numLayers).
%  
%  The weight matrix for the weight going to the ith layer from the jth layer (or a null matrix []) is located at net.LW{i,j} if net.layerConnect(i,j) is 1 (or 0).
%  
%  The weight matrix has as many rows as the size of the layer it goes to (net.layers{i}.size). It has as many columns as the product of the size of the layer it comes from with the number of delays associated with the weight.
%  
%      *
%  
%        net.layers{j}.size * length(net.layerWeights{i,j}.delays)
%  
%  These dimensions can also be obtained from the layer weight properties.
%  
%      *
%  
%        net.layerWeights{i,j}.size
%  
%  net.b
%  
%  This property defines the bias vectors for each layer with a bias. It is always an Nl x 1 cell array, where Nl is the number of network layers (net.numLayers).
%  
%  The bias vector for the ith layer (or a null matrix []) is located at net.b{i} if net.biasConnect(i) is 1 (or 0).
%  
%  The number of elements in the bias vector is always equal to the size of the layer it is associated with (net.layers{i}.size).
%  
%  This dimension can also be obtained from the bias properties.

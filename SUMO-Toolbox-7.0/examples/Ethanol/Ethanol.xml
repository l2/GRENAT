	<Name>Ethanol</Name>
	<Description>
		The engine exhaust was analysed in an experiment in which ethanol was burned in a single 
		cylinder automobile test engine. The response variable is NOx, the concentration of 
		nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the engine exhaust, normalized by the 
		work done by the engine. The explanatory variables are the compression ratio of the engine 
		and the equivalence ratio at which the engine was run - a  measure of the richness of the air/ethanol mix.

		The dataset has been scaled from:
		[7.5000, 18.0000]
    [0.5350,  1.2320]

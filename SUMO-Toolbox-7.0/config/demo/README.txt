The SUMO Toolbox - Demo config files - README
----------------------------------------------

This directory contains a couple of configuration files that illustrate some uses of the toolbox.

These files are simply for illustration, and if you have the necessary toolboxes / dependencies installed they
should work.

However, beware of using them as is for real scientific results. If you want proper, unbiased results (eg. as part
of a comparison) you still have to run through the options and think well about how to setup your experiment.

As always, you are free to contact us in case of questions.  See http://www.sumowiki.intec.ugent.be for contact details.
